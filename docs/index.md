This is the API reference and general technical guide for registers built by Government Digital Service (GDS). This guide is for developers, technical architects, and other members of service teams interested in using registers in a service.

Registers APIs provide a direct and standard way to access data so you can be confident the data in your service is accurate, up-to-date and authoritative.

You can use the data from registers to build menus and other widgets for forms. For example, you could use the country register to populate a menu for a user to select their location.

Contact the GDS registers team at registerteam@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk if you have any problems or questions that are not covered in this guide.
